Cute dogs waking up owners - Funny dog compilation：
http://youtu.be/CpbYBZKdi3s﻿I love dogs and specially mine, but seeing all these dogs walking around 
the bed grosses me out.﻿the huskey is like, wake up you bastard and play with me!﻿At 4:06 was the best﻿Ok. Look at 4:08 and tell me that is not the cutest thing in the world.﻿What type of dog is this at 1:10 PLEASE TELL ME >_< ﻿The husky at 3:39 looks more like he's saying get...the...fuck..up
Instead of trying to get the laser

it also looks like he's trying to preform CPR on the dude, you see how hard 
he pushing on him XD﻿I'll never get why anyone would ever want to harm let alone torture and to 
slaughter and eat these creatures who love us so unconditionally! ﻿2:40 ish my dog does that﻿ً﻿WAKE UP!!!﻿there is a bollywood movie named "Finding Fanny" coming out.. i am dying to 
watch it.. ha ha aha .... its epic! name for a hopefully epic movie.﻿leuk hoe honden hun baasje s'ochtends uit bed timmeren﻿1:14 HOLY FUCKING DERP﻿Too cute for words. They give so much love and joy!﻿"Cute dogs waking up owners"
My Dog loves letting off a WMD. That really wakes me up ASAP, Marine 
Sergeant style! ﻿You dumbass, how the hell is the camera man suppose to film with the lights 
off?﻿I hate dogs. Send them all to China!﻿I want a dog again soooo bad. But the state said Im not allowed to own pets 
for 10years because I drowned my sisters lab puppies when I was 16. People 
make mistakes and i want a pitbull﻿What's the name of the breed at 02:30? ﻿Violent husky
﻿To me. Dogs are cute, to Asians, dogs are delicious! Weird huh ﻿A sad way to think about it is dogs wake sleeping owners up because they 
think they are dead and so the dog tries to wake him/her up.﻿Cute woman at the end﻿
