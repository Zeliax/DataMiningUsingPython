close your eyes and it's ellie pushing merchandise﻿
Excellent. Perfect a friend of mine. Now all she needs is a rugged  lumberjack father figure dressed in a plaid shirt and she's good to go.﻿
Why do they only ship to the us and canada? :(﻿
We want clementine jacket ! ﻿
Well to me it look's like an ice cream coloured jumper. Well if you like to  look like an ice cream shop then go ahead and get it.﻿
I love her voice﻿
All the comments is about The hoody looking like triple flavoured Ice-cream  or people who wants to be girls to wear this.﻿
Does it come in manly? ﻿
Ice Cream Hoodie!﻿
It can be worn by both genders﻿
Ellie is Neopolitan  ;).﻿
I thought it was supposed to be a jacket.﻿
Not for sale anywhere but NA? Come on Sony...﻿
Neapolitan ice cream... Yummy﻿
so this is what naughty dog became, a money hungry company﻿
Lol that's awesome ﻿
Hoodie looks great. Is Erick a Filipino? My pinoy senses are tingling.﻿
I can actually see some guy buying this and wearing it for real.﻿
Why must they sell this only for females?﻿
FINALLY :D﻿
Naughty Dog, design Joel's shirt for all these male fans!﻿
Oh ya pay 60 bucks for a 20 dollar hoodie and just cause it looks like the  one ellie wore in the game that justifys the unjustified price.﻿
IT'S FINALLY A THING YES!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!﻿
That's not going to fit me.﻿
Quiero! Esa campera si es q no sala mas q una ps4﻿
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG+  KKKKKKKKKKKK﻿
Oh Ashley, oh sweet Ashley I could listen to your voice and look into your  pretty eyes all day long.﻿
Your kidding right? I can get the same jacked with different colors. This  is a waste of time, i was expecting a logo or something. Maybe it was true  that this devs are loosing money.﻿
If I saw a girl wearing this I would instantly love her. Its cool that  Ashley is wearing it.﻿
Joel's shirt would be cool too!﻿
Neapolitan ice cream﻿
Musterbrand does a better job with game base clothing.﻿
Wow... Did they make Nathan Drake's desert clothes from Uncharted 3?﻿
Look like a cheap normal hoodie from old navy or at target lol﻿
Just in time for Christmas also, I'll get this for my sister she loves  Ellie alot and plays way more Last of Us then me so this'll be a nice  surprise for her﻿
I have a sudden hankering for ice-cream now.﻿
Lol, made in china ;D﻿
Looks too clean. Throw it in some mud and guts. That'll make it legit.﻿
the real question is not "would it be weird for a man to wear this?" more  like "what the fck are they smoking trying to sell a hoodie for 60  dollars."﻿
How "Neapolitan" of them ﻿
!!!!!!! I NEED THIS﻿
What is everyone complaining about? Its a Unisex hoodie. Meaning, both  males AND females can wear it. I, for one, will be purchasing it, and will  be wearing it proudly (I'm very comfortable with my sexuality). =D﻿
