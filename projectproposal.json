Doing some sort of sentiment analysis would be interesting. With the YouTube API (gdata Python module) numerous comments can be downloaded for each video. \n The text mining technique \u201csentiment analysis\u201d determines how positive or negative a text is. In the simplest form a labeled word list is used where each word is manually labeled for valence (positive/negative).\n This project should construct a Python program that downloads comments from YouTube videos, based on a search criteria and performs sentiment analysis to rate each video, enabling queries like \u201cWhat do people think about the specific topic?\u201d", "members": [{"name": "Stine S\u00f8ndergaard", "study_number": "s113101"}, {"name": "Mette Mai Hansen", "study_number": "s084062"}, {"name": "Thomas Hammerbak", "study_number": "s093673"}], "title": "Sentiment Analysis of YouTube Comments", "modules": ["nltk", "Flask", "Flask-WTF", "Jinja2", "MarkupSafe", "Pafy", "WTForms", "Werkzeug", "astroid", "blinker", "colorama", "flake8", "gdata", "google-api-python-client", "httplib2", "itsdangerous", "logilab-common", "matplotlib", "mccabe", "mpld3", "numpy", "oauth2client", "pep257", "pep8", "pyasn1", "pyasn1-modules", "pyflakes", "pylint", "pyparsing", "python-dateutil", "python-openid", "pytz", "rsa", "simplejson", "six", "uritemplate"]}
